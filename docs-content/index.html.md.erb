 Core or Dotnet Framework apps so you can monitor them in a PCF environment.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF enables you to bind your Dotnet (Core and Framework) apps to 
New Relic Dotnet agents. This allows you to monitor the health and performance of these apps, 
analyze the data captured by agents, and additionally correlate the captured agent data with PCF infrastructure metrics and events collected by the [New Relic Firehose Nozzle](https://network.pivotal.io/products/nr-firehose-nozzle/).

The New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF can be installed via the tile in Ops Manager. 
Alternatively, you can extract the <code>.Pivotal</code> file and install individual extension buildpacks using the 
cf Command Line Interface (CLI) command <code>cf create-buildpack</code>.

After you start monitoring your apps, you can set alerts based on any metrics
that are collected by Dotnet agents using the New Relic alerting subsystem.

The New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF installs one or more of the
following buildpacks depending on the tile configuration:

+ New Relic Dotnet Core Extension Buildpack for Dotnet Core Applications (Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 and Xenial 16.04 stemcells).
  This extension buildpack is non-cached.

+ New Relic Dotnet Core Extension Cached Buildpack for Dotnet Core
   Applications (Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 and Xenial 16.04 stemcells) running in disconnected (isolated) PCF deployments

+ New Relic HWC Extension Buildpack for Dotnet Framework Applications (Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 2016 stemcells) 
  This extension buildpack is non-cached.
  This is for support of air-gapped environments where there is no access to the outside world.

+ New Relic HWC Extension Cached Buildpack for Dotnet Framework Applications
   (Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 2016 stemcells) running in disconnected (isolated) PCF deployments.
   This is in support of air-gapped environments where there is no access to the outside world.

All buildpacks use the multi-buildpack approach of Cloud Foundry and require either the standard 
Dotnet Core buildpack or HWC buildpack to be specified in the buildpack chain, either in the app 
manifest or in the <code>cf push</code> command line.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The cached version of this extension buildpack for both Dotnet Core and Dotnet Framework contains New Relic Dotnet Agents version <code>8.16.567.0</code></p>
