This documentation describes the New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF and provides instructions on how to 
install and use the tile to bind New Relic agents to Dotnet Core or Dotnet Framework applications to 
monitor them in a [PCF](https://pivotal.io/platform) environment.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF enables you to bind your Dotnet (Core and Framework) applications to 
New Relic Dotnet agents. This allows you to monitor the health and performance of these applications, 
analyze the data captured by agents, and aditionally correlate the captured agent data with PCF infrastructure metrics and events collected by the [New Relic Firehose Nozzle](https://network.pivotal.io/products/nr-firehose-nozzle/).

The New Relic Dotnet Extension Buildpack for PCF can be installed via the tile in Ops Manager. 
Alternatively, you can extract the **".pivotal"** file, and install individual extension buildpack(s) using the 
CF CLI command **"cf create-buildpack"**. 

Once you start monitoring your applications, you have the ability to set alerts based on any metrics that are collected by Dotnet agents using New Relic's alerting subsystem.


The New Relic Dotnet Extension Builpdack for PCF installs one or more of the following 4 buildpacks depending on the tile configuration:

1. New Relic Dotnet Core Extension Buildpack for Dotnet Core Applications (Ubuntu Trusty & Xenial)
1. New Relic Dotnet Core Extension Cached Buildpack for Dotnet Core Applications (Ubuntu Trusty & Xenial) running in disconnected (isolated) PCF deployments
1. New Relic HWC Extension Buildpack for Dotnet Framework Applications (Windows 2012 R2 & Windows 2016) 
1. New Relic HWC Extension Cached Buildpack for Dotnet Framework Applications (Windows 2012 R2 & Windows 2016) running in disconnected (isolated) PCF deployments

The first 2 extension buildpacks are for Dotnet Core applications running on Ubuntu Trusty (14.04) and 
Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) stemcells. 
The first extension is non-cached, and the second is a cached version of buildpack for Dotnet Core.

The 3rd and 4th buildpacks are HWC extensions for Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 2016 Stemcells. 
The third extension is non-cached, and the fourth is a cached version of the HWC extension buildpack.

All 4 buildpacks use the multi-buildpack approach of Cloud Foundry and require either the standard 
Dotnet Core buildpack or HWC buildpack to be specified in the buildpack chain, either in application's 
manifest or in the CF CLI.
